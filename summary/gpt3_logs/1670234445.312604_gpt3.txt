Small island nations have been raising this issue for 30+ years, and now it has happened after a concerted push from developing countries If we care about fixing #climatechange, we need to change course.

RESPONSE:

At the Systems Pavilion of the COP27 climate summit, soil experts are emphasizing the importance of considering the health of the planet's soil in policy discussions. The summit is also drawing attention to the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, a democracy activist and British citizen who has been in prison in Egypt for nine years and has faced persecution and psychological torture from authorities. French President Emmanuel Macron has been at the forefront of improving climate data and transparency, making France a leader on climate risk disclosure. King Charles hosted a reception at Buckingham Palace ahead of the COP27 summit for a group that included fashion designer Stella McCartney. The COP27 takes place on the frontlines of the converging climate, food, energy, health, and debt crises in Africa. The goal is to drive action in five key areas: climate finance, emissions cuts, crisis support framework, fulfilling Glasgow promises, and global stocktake. Prime Minister Mohammad Shahbaz Sharif of Pakistan arrived in Sharm El-Sheikh to participate in the summit, while US Climate Envoy John Kerry called for more dramatic carbon cuts. The destruction of the Amazon rainforest is accelerating almost to a point of no return. Small island nations have been advocating for Loss and Damage finance for 30+ years and it has finally made it onto the COP27 agenda after a concerted push from developing countries. Rishi Sunak's potential U-turn on COP27 is seen as a bad sign for his future leadership. Global warming is seen as an opportunity for oil drilling according to US cables published by Julian Assange. Nicola Sturgeon has begun taking selfies at COP27 and Boris Johnson has interrupted his holiday to attend. Forests are seen as the most available cost-effective climate solution with countries needing to mobilize funds for 1 gigaton reduction in forest emissions by 2025. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon chaired a meeting of her Environmental Council yesterday ahead of COP27. The 'good news' from COP27 according to UNEP is the 'Loss and Damage' claim proposal. President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and UN Chief Antonio Guterres received Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who is participating in the COP27 meetings. Fossil fuels have taken the planet from less than 1 billion people to 8 billion people while CO2 emissions have led to greener Earth than ever before. Nicola Sturgeon's strategic adviser Liz Lloyd is also attending COP27 with her at taxpayer's expense. Sanaa is on her way to Egypt to attend COP27 and raise Alaa's case as he is on water strike and they only have limited days to save him. 616 million children live in South Asia, which is the epicenter of the climate crisis, and experienced record amounts of climate-induced devastation this year. Nicola Sturgeon's photographer is reportedly the busiest person at COP27 while Queen Nicola Sturgeon herself appears to be getting on well with her trip. Germanys toughest delegate has picked up her job fighting with the hardest red lines for her safe future while First Minister Rishi Sunak is delivering 11.6 billion in pledges to Nairobi, Kenya, Pakistan, Somalia, etc., ignoring his voter base in the process. One 14 year old girl shared her experience witnessing landslides due to harsh weather conditions which have disturbed her since then and will not allow her to rest until something is done about changing climate conditions. Finally, Alaa Abd El-Fattah has already won this round no matter how it ends as he will be free of Sisi's prisons; however, it will be us who will suffer great loss if he does not get released soon enough.
