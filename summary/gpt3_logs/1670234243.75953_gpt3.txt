Oliver Dowden's claim that PM is "personally committed" to climate action is ludicrous - shamed into going to #COP27, he plans huge new oil and gas extraction, has failed to meet financial pledges to climate vulnerable countries, and removed climate ministers from Cabinet #kuenssberg PM has no credibility when he urges others at #COP27 to keep Glasgow commitments when his own Govt hasnt met finance pledges, hasnt raised ambition of UK emission cuts, is continuing fossil fuel subsidies, wont rule out new coal and is greenlighting more oil and gas #WalkTheTalk I have made a dramatic U-turn from not giving a toss about climate change to being forced to pretend I give a toss about climate change.#COP27 Rishi Sunak trumpets his plan for "investing in renewables" - is this the same plan that includes banning onshore wind, blocks new solar farms, and a windfall tax with a gigantic loophole for continued climate-wrecking fossil fuel investment? #COP27 Hypocrisy.#COP27 Do as we say, but not as we do.#COP27 The climate crisis is the fight of our lives - and we are losing.But one thing is certain: those that give up are sure to lose.So lets fight on together.And lets win.#COP27 The man in the last row is our PM.

RESPONSE:

At the United Nations Climate Summit (#COP27) in Sharm El Sheikh City, Egypt, leaders are gathering to discuss urgent action on climate change. UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has warned global leaders that they are on a "highway to climate hell" and must take urgent action before it is too late. He has also been criticized for hypocrisy, as he has accepted money from donors with fossil fuel connections and has stopped the Climate Minister from attending Cabinet. He has also flip-flopped on even attending #COP27 at all. The event is sponsored by Coca-Cola, the world's top plastic polluter, which produces 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year. Over 400 private jets have flown in world leaders to attend the summit. In addition, supporters of Just Stop Oil have blocked traffic on the M25, demanding that the government halt all new oil and gas consents and licenses. Meanwhile, young people like Yaala from Maldives are paying the highest price for a crisis not of their making, prompting world leaders to take immediate action. At the summit, decision makers need to step up and agree on a clear roadmap reflective of the scale and urgency of the challenge. This includes introducing a Loss and Damage finance facility, providing compensation and liabilities from rich countries (historical polluters), and finding African solutions to Africa's problems to create a more resilient continent. Finally, Prime Minister Sunak was rushed off conference room by his aides ahead of his speech at #COP27 in mysterious circumstances. The outcome of #COP27 would be very different if attendance were limited to only those who will be alive in 2050, as humanity is at a tipping point and time is running out to answer the planet's distress signal with ambitious, credible #ClimateAction.
