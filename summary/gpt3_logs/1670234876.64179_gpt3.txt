The COP27 climate conference is set to begin today in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. This summit is a historic opportunity for countries to discuss and enact ambitious climate goals, especially in terms of agriculture and food systems. Developed countries are being called upon to reduce their emissions, while providing resources to those countries most vulnerable to climate change. However, there is some skepticism surrounding the conference due to the potential presence of the oil industry and the possible crackdown of dissenters by Egyptian authorities. Despite this, there is a strong call for action on climate change, with a recognition of the progress made since 2015 and a commitment to continue working towards ambitious goals. There is also a question as to why certain world leaders are attending the summit. Consequently, this conference presents an important chance for countries such as Pakistan and Rwanda to take a stand on climate change and ensure that the necessary steps are taken to avoid catastrophe.
