RESPONSE:

At the start of COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, world leaders and negotiators are coming together to ensure that the promises made at the Glasgow COP are kept and built upon. It is essential that countries act with urgency and accelerated action to protect our planet and future. Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif met with United Nations Secretary General H.E Antonio Guterres on the sidelines of the summit to discuss how the UN is helping Pakistan gain access to climate finance and how they can strengthen climate commitments. Rishi Sunak was asked about Boris Johnson's presence at the summit and he said it showed the UKs great commitment, having both present and past PMs there. The Green Gigaton Challenge sets a milestone of mobilizing funds to pay for the equivalent of one gigaton of high-quality emissions reductions from forests between 2020-2025, and yearly thereafter. The finance agenda for COP27 was adopted, with rich countries bullying poorer nations to agree to a language to protect historical polluters from compensation and liability. President Kagame spoke at the Terra Carta Action Forum, stressing that while human activity is the cause of the climate crisis, it can also be the solution. The UN chief unveiled a plan to provide everyone on Earth with early warnings against extreme and dangerous weather by 2027. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also left for Egypt to participate in the summit. Despite promises made by the Paris Agreement, support for fossil fuels by G-20 nations has reached its highest level since 2014. Alaa Abd El-Fattah is an Egyptian political prisoner on hunger strike for 200+ days in prison, escalating to a water strike when COP begins. His family and friends have done everything possible to work for his release, and his son Khaled (Dodo) went to a sit-in for Alaa with his aunt. Public-private partnerships are seen as the core of any effective response to the climate emergency, as they open the door to new business models, economic incentives, and scientific innovations. The Prime Minister of Finland delivered Finland's statement at COP27 stressing that there is no time to waste in protecting each other and the planet from climate change. Rwanda is dedicated to delivering ambitious climate commitments as they are seen as a leader in climate change. Boris Johnson's attendance at COP27 is being questioned as it appears he is there for a photo opportunity rather than any real action on climate change. Pakistan is hosting their first info-series on covering the Climate Crisis, environment, economics, and sustainable public policy from Pakistan and around the world. Joe Biden is attending despite having pressing domestic issues due to how important it is that nations cooperate in order to fight against climate change. People are being reminded that this cannot be a conference of promises but must be a conference of commitments as our children need climate justice now.
