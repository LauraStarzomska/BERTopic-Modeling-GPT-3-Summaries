DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The upcoming COP27 in Egypt is a crucial opportunity for world leaders to address the global climate crisis and its devastating effects. Droughts, heatwaves, and floods have had a detrimental impact on food production, leading to a global food crisis that can only be solved by managing the climate crisis. To prevent hunger, leaders must commit to finding climate solutions and work towards a shared global goal for nature. Scotland's First Minister recently met with the Prime Minister of Barbados to discuss collaborating on energy, addressing loss and damage, and achieving climate justice. At the opening of COP27, world leaders will be urged to take urgent action and find common ground in order to make meaningful progress on their climate promises. Indigo Rumblelow, a spokesperson from Just Stop Oil, pointed out that the government is complicit in issuing more licenses and consents for new oil and gas, which will take the world over 1.5C. UN Secretary-General called for a historic pact between developed and emerging economies in order to avoid runaway climate change. UNICEF called on world leaders to ensure children are at the center of climate decisions. With the election of HE Sameh Shoukry as COP27 President by the Parties, the opening plenary of COP27 has commenced. Rishi Sunak's multi-billion COP27 giveaway has been criticized for rehashing the 11.6bn already committed in Glasgow without addressing loss and damage finance or the $300M missing from adaptation funds. Lula's victory over Bolsonaro in Brazil is great news for our global climate, while Rishi Sunak's attendance at COP27 has been met with criticism due to his lack of action on climate change. The World Leaders Summit at COP27 is an opportunity to rebuild trust and establish ambition needed to avoid driving our planet over the cliff. It is also an opportunity for countries like Denmark with ambitious green plans to inspire others to take action on climate change. Indigo Rumblelow also pointed out that many of those preaching about saving the planet still lead luxurious lifestyles that contribute greatly to carbon emissions. Finally, at COP27 Rwanda launched Ireme Invest - Rwanda’s green investment facility - which raised $104 million in its first capitalization.
