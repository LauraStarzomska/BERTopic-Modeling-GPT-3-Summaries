DETAILED SUMMARY: 

==========

RESPONSE:

The 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27) is a climate change discussion that must count for people and planet. It has been revealed that the oil industry was the biggest delegation at COP last year and probably this year, suggesting that scientists should be the main focus instead. Global mean sea level rise has doubled since 1993, with a 10mm rise since January 2020. This threatens millions of coastal inhabitants. The regime in Egypt has prevented critics from attending COP27 and is surveilling those who are there, raising concern of a severe crackdown after the conference. Laura Kuenssberg opened the BBC asking if we can afford to tackle the climate crisis, which many have deemed an out-of-date question in the midst of a climate crisis. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon are all attending COP27. Alaa Abd El Fattah, a British citizen and pro-democracy activist, remains in prison in Egypt and many are calling for his release before COP27 begins. The opening ceremony will be streamed live on November 6th at 10AM GMT+2. There is criticism of Johnson's attendance as he does not have a mandate from the public and is spending millions on his cronies. Sturgeon's attendance is also being questioned as her remit is domestic and she does not have the authority to make decisions on behalf of other nations. Environment and Forestry Cabinet Secretary Soipan Tuya has arrived for COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh and is attending Africa Group Negotiator meetings. Alaa Abd El Fattah has announced he will go on a hunger strike starting November 6th if his situation is not resolved before then. COPTV has arrived live from Sharm El Sheikh with updates on ground action and conversations at COP27. The question of who foots the bill for Rishi Sunak's attendance has been raised, as well as why he is there in the first place. It is suggested that those attending should take stock of what is discussed at COP27, advocate for key recommendations, and focus on climate-related work to drive conversation. COP27 will be an implementation summit to keep track of promises in order to keep 1.5 degrees in reach. There is criticism that it's being used as an excuse for world leaders to pretend there is an emergency without actually taking action against it. People are heading to COP27 from all over, some having attended every one since its inception except Bali and India COPs due to maternity leave. The main challenges discussed will be green jobs for youth, just transition, climate finance, loss and damage, climate justice, and thermal mitigation.
