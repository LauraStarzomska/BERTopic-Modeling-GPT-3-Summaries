The world's elite have arrived at #COP27 on hundreds of private jets to lecture you about climate change. Sponsored by Coca-Cola.
Friends 🤝Partners 🌍Allies 🇬🇧🇫🇷Great to meet with  today at #COP27.
At this point, maybe we should ask women for help. #COP27
“Climate change will ravage our planet without urgent action.”~Rishi Sunak #COP27
I have just warned global leaders at #COP27:We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.Our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible.We need urgent #ClimateAction.
Rich people flying private jets to UN talks sponsored by Coca Cola that give the fossil fuel industry a huge seat at the table while criminalizing climate activists is NOT the way to stop irreversible catastrophic fossil-fueled global heating. #COP27
COP27 is sponsored by Coca-Cola - the world’s top plastic polluter, who produce 120 billion throwaway plastic bottles a year.#COP27 #Greenwash
Over 400 private jets with world leaders flying to #COP27 climate summit to discuss how to reduce carbon emission 🤡
My brother just had his last glass of water in prison. Please keep his story alive, it's not over. He can be saved.This afternoon I'm flying to Sharm, I have a civil society pass. The Egyptian regime claims civic space exists in #COP27 , I'll be testing that.#FreeAlaa
Off to Egypt to attend #COP27
Incoming reports of Polish journalists and business leaders plying the Ukrainian national anthem on their phones whenever they spot a group of Russians at the #COP27 UN Climate Summit starting in Egypt.The Russians aren’t happy.
This is the dude who will be lecturing you about your carbon footprint at #COP27
Finally! #COP27 And also great to see you keeping up the Conservative tradition of regular U-turns. 👏
Oliver Dowden's claim that PM is "personally committed" to climate action is ludicrous - shamed into going to #COP27, he plans huge new oil and gas extraction, has failed to meet financial pledges to climate vulnerable countries, and removed climate ministers from Cabinet #kuenssberg
PM has no credibility when he urges others at #COP27 to keep Glasgow commitments when his own Govt hasn’t met finance pledges, hasn’t raised ambition of UK emission cuts, is continuing fossil fuel subsidies, won’t rule out new coal and is greenlighting more oil and gas #WalkTheTalk
I have made a dramatic U-turn from not giving a toss about climate change to being forced to pretend I give a toss about climate change.#COP27
Rishi Sunak trumpets his plan for "investing in renewables" - is this the same plan that includes banning onshore wind, blocks new solar farms, and a windfall tax with a gigantic loophole for continued climate-wrecking fossil fuel investment? #COP27
Hypocrisy.#COP27
“Do as we say, but not as we do.”#COP27
The climate crisis is the fight of our lives - and we are losing.But one thing is certain: those that give up are sure to lose.So let’s fight on together.And let’s win.#COP27
The man in the last row is our PM. His country suffered the most recently due to climate change. #COP27
You had to be dragged kicking and screaming into showing up at all. When real leadership is required at home and abroad, we have a weak and wobbly Prime Minister on a day trip.#COP27
Simple, effective message on Pakistan pavilion at #COP27.
How on Earth can Rishi Sunak claim he's "delivering" on #climateemergency? Under his "leadership" we've seen climate ministers booted from cabinet, a swathe of new oil and gas licences, failure to rule out Cumbria coal mine and flip-flopping on even attending #COP27 at all
⚠️ #climatechange demands URGENT action from everyone. ⚠️Renewables are the solution to the climate and energy crises. ♻️ Let's accelerate the energy transition NOW. #COP27
Ed Miliband’s “climate reparations” shows that people like him on the left have lost their marbles. #COP27
In case you missed it - Egypt lit up Khafre Pyramid, one of the three ancient pyramids of Giza that date back 4,500 years, ahead of #COP27. #TogetherForImplementation
We met with fellow leaders of African nations on the sidelines of #COP27 to discuss bilateral and regional issues. We will continue to work in solidarity to find African solutions to Africa's problems and strive for a more resilient continent.
As the world leaders prepare to travel to #COP27 to discuss climate change, here’s a reminder of how Joe Biden arrived in Glasgow for #COP26
Are we ever going to get a PM that doesn’t bow down to media and leftist pressure?How weak   #COP27
Humanity is at a tipping point.#COP27 must achieve climate justice, support the poorest for loss and damage, and deliver systemic change on a global scale. We are running out of time. Solidarity with climate activists and human rights defenders who cannot wait any longer.
Held discussions with leaders of several countries on bilateral and strategic issues alongside #COP27. I also met with leaders of continental and international organizations to discuss issues of mutual interest. (1/2)
UK prime minister  has just been rushed out of the room by his aides during the middle of the launch for forests partnership at #COP27
We need a loss and damage finance facility. We need climate justice. We need action.Time is running out, which is why decision makers need to step up at #COP27 #GenerateAction ⏰
Yesterday, Minister of Affairs Mélanie Joly and I arrived in Egypt for #COP27.So far this year, I've flown over 12 million kilometres to tell the world that Canadians pollute too much.All of the  leaders agree, there is only one solution - higher taxes.
🚨 BREAKING: M25 BLOCKED 🚨🚧 Supporters of Just Stop Oil have climbed onto overhead gantries on the M25 at multiple locations, halting traffic. They are demanding that the Government halts all new oil and gas consents and licences — anything less is a death sentence.#COP27
#COP27 is now underway. Come on humans. You can do it! There is lots to do and no time to loose. #DontChooseExtinction
COP 27: How many billionaires are gonna land in private jets to lecture us about our consumption habits this year? #COP27
Happy #COP27 week, one and all!
They told us to wear masks and socially distance. Yet they held lavish parties.They told us to save the planet. Yet they travelled by private jet and motorcade. They told us to play by their rules but they played by their own set of rules. They are taking the piss.#COP27
United Nations Climate Summit #COP27 kicks off today at Sharm El Sheikh City, Egypt 🇪🇬. Finally, Loss and Damage Finance agenda is adopted today at #COP27 which will seek compensation and liabilities from the rich countries (historical polluters).It's time for #ClimateJustice.
#COP27 begins today 🌍On climate, the world will succeed or fail as one. We must make these two weeks count.
BREAKING: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak rushed off conference room by his aides ahead of his speech at #COP27 in mysterious circumstances
The outcome of #COP27 would be very different if attendance were limited to only those who will be alive in 2050.
The last 8 years are on track to be the warmest on record.Sea levels are rising at twice the speed of the 1990s.We must answer the planet’s distress signal with ambitious, credible #ClimateAction.#COP27 must be the place – and now must be the time.
I want to turn the UK into a green energy superpower! Which is why I accepted £141k from donors with fossil fuel connections, said I was too busy to attend #COP27 and stopped the Climate Minister attending Cabinet.
Sunak earnestly tells  that it’s “great to have the current prime minister and the last PM at #COP27 because it shows how we’re leading the world in the debate”Yeah right! That’ll be it. Rather than a pair of total frauds engaged in an ego-wrestling sideshow.
Imagine having to live with this frightening possibility.  Young people, like Yaala from Maldives, are paying the highest price for a crisis not of their making.  #COP27
The deliberations by the world leaders will shape the future of our struggle against climate change. What we face today is the challenge of the century. We have a duty to leave a clean and green environment to our coming generations. At #COP27, we should vow to succeed at all costs
On the way to #COP27 Egypt 🇪🇬. 🙏#RoadToCOP27
Finally, I will leave tomorrow for Egypt 🇪🇬 to attend the #COP27 representing India 🇮🇳 and voice of the millions of children of the world to urge our world leaders to deliver concrete climate action on loss and damage caused by the climate crisis. It's time for climate justice! 🙏
🧵🚨For the duration #COP27 I’ll be doing something different here. This account will be a portal to the Egypt that is currently being covered up by some epic police-state-controlled/Coca-Cola-sponsored/Hill+Knowlton-spun greenwashing.
Glad to see Sunak's screeching U-turn on #COP27, but what an embarrassing mis-step on the world stage. Let this be a lesson to him - climate leadership matters. Now he urgently needs to increase UK ambition on emission reduction targets and pay what we owe to global climate funds
We informed the police and the highway authority yesterday that the #M25 would be disrupted — they knew but chose not to warn the public.Sound familiar?Fire, floods, drought — disruption from climate chaos won’t end. We must stop new oil and gas now.#COP27 #ClimateChange
The impacts of climate change are here now, and the loss and damage they cause can no longer be ignored.#COP27 must agree on a clear, time-bound roadmap reflective of the scale and urgency of the challenge.It's a moral imperative and a question of solidarity and climate justice
“Climate change should be seen as the greatest challenge to face man and treated as a much bigger priority in the United Kingdom.”– King Charles III 🤡#COP27
For the first time since the adoption of the UN climate convention, Parties agreed to introduce #LossAndDamage funding as an agenda item at the climate conference. (1/2) #COP27
When our private jet and motorcade travelling political leaders hypocritically virtue signal at #COP27 (sponsored by Coca-Cola) they have conveniently forgotten that they contributed to an environmental catastrophe. Over 3 billion Covid masks now pollute the oceans.
“That desperate hope is why the world is looking to you and why you are here”A year ago today, Sir David Attenborough addressed world leaders at the #COP26 opening ceremony.With less than one week until #COP27, his powerful words still ring true 👇
Polish journalist covering the #COP27 UN Climate Summit in Egypt greets Russians in the hotel restaurant with a patriotic Ukrainian song and a loud “Slava Ukraini”.🇵🇱🇺🇦
Good first meeting with Prime Minister  in the margins of #COP27We face many common challenges, from tackling climate change and the energy transition to Russia’s war against Ukraine. I look forward to a constructive 🇪🇺🇬🇧cooperation based on our agreements.
What we must do immediately:1) End the use of fossil fuels2) Build massive amounts of solar and wind3) Electrify everything4) Conserve5) Find solutions for the last hard stuff (planes, cement)6) Stop cutting down trees.#ActOnClimate #climate #COP27
This evening in Sharm El-Sheikh, President Kagame held talks with President Dr. William Ruto of Kenya ahead of #COP27. The two leaders discussed the continued positive and fruitful bilateral relationship between Kenya and Rwanda.
#ClimateChange is about consumption of the very richest 💸 people in our global society.50% of global emissions are emitted by just 10% of the population.90% of global emissions by 50% of the population.#COP27 needs to recognise climate justice and the rich💰must change NOW
Some thoughts (and questions) on #COP27. First, if no plan for quickly ramping down the fossil fuel industry comes out of the meeting, it's a failure. That's the bottom line. Fossil fuels are the cause. Ramping down that industry MUST be the very core of any solutions package.
These 4 countries are almost entirely powered by #renewableenergy:1. Iceland 🇮🇸 2. Paraguay 🇵🇾 3. Norway 🇳🇴 4. Costa Rica 🇨🇷We have the solutions. #ActOnClimate#ClimateEmergency #climate #tech #renewables #renewableenergy #GreenNewDeal #cop27egypt #cop27
Cannot believe that  has not been allowed to answer COP26 Questions today, days before #COP27 in Egypt. Just another sign that this climate-wrecking PM does not get it
Droughts, heatwaves and floods have a devastating impact on food production.The unfolding global food crisis cannot be stopped until nations manage the climate crisis.At #COP27, leaders must commit to find climate solutions that can help stop and prevent hunger.
We urgently need a shared global goal for nature, just like the 1.5C goal we already have for climate. Halting biodiversity loss is not enough, say  and  we must be #NaturePositive by 2030.#COP27 #COP15
First Minister  met  Prime Minister of Barbados, ahead of #COP27 in Egypt.Scotland is committed to engaging with Barbados and to find new areas of collaboration, particularly on energy, addressing #LossAndDamage, and achieving #ClimateJustice.
Tomorrow, during the opening of #COP27, I will send a clear signal to world leaders:The urgency of the #ClimateCrisis demands that we do things differently.Let us use COP27 to find common ground, so that we can reflect this urgency in our actions.
The RSPB calls on  to attend #COP27 in Egypt. Nature and climate emergencies are deeply intertwined. We need the PM to build on the legacy of Glasgow COP26 and show global leadership. He needs to be a positive advocate for the role of nature in solving this global crisis.
They are treating us like suckers. #COP27
Sunak's £multi-billion #COP27 giveaway will stick in the throats of Red Wall voters still waiting for "levelling up" money promised in 2019How can Sunak find £billions for "clean energy" in the Third World, when working class voters can't even afford to switch on the heating?

Last year, I asked world leaders to open their hearts before entering COP26 negotiations.Many have yet to take the climate crisis seriously.At #COP27 , leaders must show that they care about people and open their eyes to the realities of climate inaction!
Droughts in Europe made the "Hunger Stones" visible this year. These stones were used to mark desperately low river levels that would forecast famines. This one, in Elbe river, is from 1616 and says: "If you see me, cry"There is no time to wait. #ActOnClimate #climate #COP27
Heading to #COP27 along with half the plane! I’ve been to all of them since COP1 but missed Bali and India COPs due to maternity leave. My kids have grown as have #GHG emissions due to #FossilFuels. Will be working on #climatejustice #JustTransition #LossAndDamage
#COP27 being held in Egypt can be a watershed in humanity's fight against climate change and global warming. Extreme climatic events in Pakistan and Horn of Africa this year have showcased globalisation of climate change. Turning a blind eye to its lethal effects will be criminal.1/3
Elected #COP27 President HE Sameh Shoukry addresses climate envoys and delegates at the opening plenary.

Climate disasters are already hurting countries, communities and economies.Next week, #COP27 will start in Egypt and present a crucial opportunity for leaders to make meaningful progress on climate promises.#ClimateAction must become the global priority we need it to be.

Catastrophic climate disasters continue to upend the lives of millions of children in South Asia, leaving them desperately in need of support to survive.   As world leaders unite at #COP27, UNICEF calls on them to ensure children are at the centre of climate decisions.
Oil and natural gas will be playing an ongoing role in Africa’s energy mix for years to come. Renewables are expensive, unreliable and can’t do the heavy lifting for now. We need to drill for Gas and Make Energy Poverty History while fighting Climate Change. #cop27egypt #COP27

#COP27 must put us back on track to:Cut emissionsBoost climate resilience and adaptationKeep the promise on climate financeAddress loss and damage resulting from the climate crisis.
Boris Johnson showing up at #COP27 is like when David Brent kept turning up at work after being sacked
I have to leave yesterday for #COP27 Egypt 🇪🇬 but due to short of funds, I’m getting delayed. I’m going to travel all the way for thousands of kilometres from India by selling tea is to tell our world leaders to provide urgent climate finance now to save our planetand our future.

Now Rishi Sunak is attending #COP27 will the Govt lift that ridiculous ban on King Charles attending too?
🦺 Indigo Rumblelow, 28, a spokesperson for Just Stop Oil from London said:“What did you expect? This Government is complicit in an illegal and unconstitutional plan to issue more licences and consents for new oil and gas — a plan that will take the world over 1.5°C…#COP27 #M25

"Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish.“Speaking at the World Leaders Summit at #COP27, UN Secretary-General  called for a historic pact between developed and emerging economies" to avoid runaway #ClimateChange.
We face many challenges, but climate change is the biggest.This #COP27 will be a implementation summit to keep track of promises.We need to do everything we can to keep 1.5 degrees in reach Europe stays the course.
This is hardly a "major new package" from Rishi Sunak at #COP27 - it's rehashing the £11.6bn already committed in Glasgow. Where's the #LossAndDamage finance? What about the $300M missing that we owe to adaptation funds? Creative accounting won't solve the #climateemergency
As  we will be holding people to account – be they Presidents, Prime Ministers or CEOs.Our policies, our businesses, our infrastructure, our actions, must all align with the #ParisAgreement.My signal of change today at the opening of #COP27.
“We still have a chance but we’re  rapidly losing it. I’d say 1.5C is in intensive care.  So either we act immediately and in a very strong way, or it’s lost and probably lost for ever.” Spot on from  on huge amount at stake at #COP27
#COP27 must deliver massive emissions reductions, money for loss and damage with social justiceAs #ClimateChange negotiations have failed over the last 30 years. 🤦‍♂️Carbon dioxide levels still going up ⬆️ causing rising global temperatures 🌡1.2°C and rising ➡️ 🌪💨⛈🌀🌊🔥🥵

I haven't flown in a plane since 2012 as I see so clearly how every flight makes the Earth irreversibly hotter and everything that means. No way I'd fly to a corporate greenwash-fest like #COP27. COP must prove it's serious about ending the fossil fuel industry. That's on them.

Multiple homes, multiple cars, private jets, helicopters etcThe hypocrisy of most of these that are preaching at us, is astounding.The #COP27 event is just for soundbites,virtue signalling and political dodgy dealings masked up as climate support.The average Brit is sick of it.
They asked 11 years old girl about carbon emissions when I fly to attend the #COP27. Did they ever ask the same to Modi ji when he travel to attend COPs?This is not a free trip. This is the result of hard work and sweats of last 5 years.🙏Atleast I offset my carbon footprints.
Always a pleasure joining  on  This time from #COP27 in Egypt. We discussed climate, loss and damage, flooding in Pakistan, effects of the Russia-Ukrainian crisis and the attack on former PM.  Thread below ⬇️ 🧵

Rishi Sunak’s #COP27 dithering nearly left us empty chaired on the world stage. He just doesn’t get it.Real leadership would safeguard Britain’s industrial future. Energy security, new jobs, valuable exports and cutting bills for good.✍🏻

Prime Minister at #COP27 for 1 day; leader of devolved administration with council leader in tow 4 days?strange but true
A year ago, world leaders agreed to "phase down" coal. Since then, consumption has set records. #COP27
Nepal is one of the climate leaders in South Asia having joined both the Global Methane Pledge (GMP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC).  I hope other countries follow their lead at #COP27.
There is a Children and Youth Pavilion ( at #COP27  Please do visit and explore it. This is a first of its kind initiative to heard the voices of the children and youth at UN Climate Summit.

Three points:1. In 2008, apocalyptics predicted the snows of Kilimanjaro would disappear by 2020. Nope.2. In 2009, they predicted Glacier National Park glaciers would be gone by 2020. Nope.3. Nope, no alarmist prediction has ever come true. #COP27
The start of #COP27 has kicked off the annual festival of takes from people who don't really think climate change is a problem. So, here for the eleventy-hundredth time, is a thread on why their arguments are reckless to the point of being genuinely dangerous.
#COP27 has started! So exciting to meet the amazing  and learn from her incredible initiatives for #Youth4COP27 at the  Pavilion #Youth4Health #HealthyPlanet
As #COP27 starts tomorrow, Govt must remember #climateemergency could cost *£580bn a year* by 2030, yet rich countries are utterly failing to pull their weight. We *must* provide #lossanddamage finance to bring climate justiceMe for  👇
Our Climate Policy Factbook w/  reveals G-20 member countries increased support for coal, oil, gas and fossil fuel power by 16% in 2021. Ahead of #COP27, countries must be held accountable for their commitment to the Paris Agreement:

Climate and nature are two sides of the same coin. We cannot solve one without the other.At #COP27, alongside continuing commitments of deep cuts to emissions, countries should put nature on their agendas. Together we can tackle the #ClimateCrisis and reverse nature loss.

Two points:1. There's been no warming in 8 years, despite 14% of total emissions.2. Warmest in 'modern times'? So why was it so warm in earlier... like 1,000 years ago...before coal plants, SUVs and cheeseburgers?🤔Climate is a hoax. #COP27

Finance for #LossAndDamage at #COP27 is vital. Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Dominica cost 226% of that country’s GDP, with 100% crops destroyed. Grant Shapps says UK agrees “there’s a discussion to be had”.But we need more than words - finance needs to be on table *now*
My  colleague  and I are now working with a team of trusted journalists, lawyers, scholars + activists on the ground in Egypt. They are collecting stories and testimonies from outside the #COP27 green bubble.
If #COP27 countries were serious about climate actionthe would Ban all new oil gas coal drillingBan all fossil fuel subsidiesBan all deforestationBan draining wetlandsBan private JetsBan new airports and roads expansionsRation air travel They will not do any of this

Charles is a grade-A hypocrite on the environment and represents the worst polluters. He's not an expert, he's not a good advocate and he's not a government official who can negotiate with other nations. He has no business going to #COP27 #NotMyKing
Does Rishi Sunak really need to go to #COP27? Does any world leader?In a word. No. And frankly they shouldn't. Hear me out: 🧵

Intervention at #COP27 by   The #climatecrisis and the #LossAndDamage it causes affects the rights of millions of people. This crisis requires every voice, every effort, every solution. It especially needs this from those on the frontlines.
The planet is telling us loudly and clearly that it has reached its limit.Climate action must be our top global priority:  #COP27
Not remotely convinced by Sunak urging world leaders to “summon the collective will” to cap global rise in temperatures at #COP27 when he didn’t want to go to the summit at all and plans to use half the already reduced foreign aid budget at home.Words vs actions again.(Times)
In many places on earth, every breath a person takes is polluted. RT if you agree that we should put an end to the fossil fuel addiction. #COP27
Thinking of  as #COP27 starts. Stay strong dear one. May you never be defeated. #FreeAlaa
A kind reminder for world leaders at #COP27:This cannot be a conference of promises.This must be a conference of commitments.Our children need climate justice, now.

The UN climate conference #COP27 is about to kick off in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Every government, every business, every investor, every institution - EVERYBODY must commit to much faster, bolder #ClimateAction to protect our planet and our future.
Rwanda is a climate change leader and dedicated to delivering ambitious climate commitments. Today at #COP27, I met the Minster of Foreign Affairs,  to discuss how the 🇬🇧 is helping 🇷🇼 gain access to climate finance and how we can strengthen climate commitments.
Sunak asked about Johnson’s presence #COP27 said that it showed the UK’s great commitment,  having the present and past PM there. In a normal union of equals, he would also have included a mention of Scotland’s FM being there. But no, they cannot bring themselves to do even that.
For me, #COP27 is overshadowed by the Egyptian government's imprisonment of our friend and comrade Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who has stopped drinking water as part of his hunger strike. His son Khaled (Dodo) went to the sit-in for Alaa, with  his aunt. #FreeAlaa
🚨Tomorrow 🚨The eyes of the world will be on Sharm El-Sheikh as #COP27 kicks off in 🇪🇬Over the next two weeks, world leaders and negotiators will come together to ensure that the #ClimateAction promises made at the Glasgow COP are kept and built upon.
The decisions of the next two weeks will define the future of humanity. We are in a #climateemergency and only with unprecedented action we will be able to change the course of this crisis.#COP27
This is shattering news. Alaa will either be free in the next days or he will die in prison during #COP27 as the world watches. His family + friends have done everything possible to work for his release. He is a hero in jail for sharing a Facebook post about torture. #FreeAlaa

Can't your researchers be arsed to brief you?Can't you be arsed to find out?Or is your question just another wee pop at the elected head of Scotland's government who has a defined formal role in #COP27?
#COP27 The insouciant arrogance of telling Joe Biden and Emmanuel Macron that he is busy, as if they had no “pressing domestic issues”, ignores how much he needs them. Get these planet killing venal libertarian bastards out of office once and for all.

Today - before going to #COP27 this weekend - I visited Sanaa, sister of Alaa Abd El-Fattah who is a political prisoner on hunger strike for 200+ days in Egypt. When COP begins, he will escalate this to a water strike. The climate movement must stand in solidarity with #FreeAlaa

This is not a “distraction” from #COP27. Egypt is on the frontlines of the climate crisis, from heatwaves to sea-level rise. Without a focus on justice, the future will be one of technical fixes for some at the expense of a livable environment in Egypt + the world’s majority.
Today, I had the pleasure of meeting with the incredible team of #COP27 volunteers. Their operational support is critical to ensuring a successful outcome. Without their hard work, COP27 would not be possible.

🚨#COP27 kicks off in a few hours! will participate to: ✔️Drive the conversation on our climate-related work✔️Take stock of what is discussed at COP27 ✔️Advocate for key recommendations aligned with the AU-EU partnership 🔍More ⤵️
Nicola Sturgeon is a devolved administrator.Her remit is for internal and domestic matters.Seriously WTAF is she doing at #COP27?It’s like sending Joey Essex to NASA’s Planetary Mechanics Convention.
Alaa is done! He won't go through another year in this horrid nightmareHe wrote to us: starting tomorrow full hunger strike, no calorie intake whatsoeverStarting Novemeber 6th with #Cop27 he will go on a water strikeIf   don't resolve this he will die

Look who made it to the Blue Zone despite his government’s best efforts. Thanks very much and all who have helped #COP27
Powerful piece here from  on what #COP27 must mean for Africa. “Climate action and renewables are not a luxury: they are indivisible for building peace, security, stability and prosperity.
“We must acknowledge a harsh truth, there is no adapting to a growing number of catastrophes causing enormous suffering around the world. The deadly impacts of #ClimateChange are here and now. #LossAndDamage can no longer be swept under the rug.”  SG at #COP27.
#COP27  Gore pedals the line "if we get to Net Zero, temperatures will stop rising - within as little as 3 to 5 years" - This is very misleading and a very dangerous narrative. It ignores locked-in warming and the need for thermal mitigation.
will say this about Scottish nationalists,they lack a sense of humour, crack a joke at nippy’s expense and their like, ‘I’ll report you to the police’ seriously, lighten up, I know you got beat in ‘14 but get over it #COP27
I've started my work in Sharm-el-Sheikh, where I'll spend November at #COP27 doing my best to advocate for practical and scalable solutions on green jobs for youth, just transition, and climate finance, + elevate young Eastern European voices in these tough times. Let's catch up!
We face many challenges, but climate change is the biggest.This #COP27    will be a implementation summit to keep track of promises.We need to do everything we can to keep 1.5 degrees in reach.
#COP27 is a jolly boys outing for world leaders to pretend there is a climate emergency, they fly in on private jets and tell us we must fly less,when are people going to wake up.
Heading to #COP27 along with half the plane! I’ve been to all of them since COP1 but missed Bali and India COPs due to maternity leave. My kids have grown as have #GHG emissions due to #FossilFuels. Will be working on #climatejustice #JustTransition #LossAndDamage
How much did it costto send Reluctant Sunak? Who foots the bill for  attendance? and why is he there?Perhaps  could investigate Kay?#COP27
